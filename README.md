# FlyingPanda-s-DCS-Missions
Unified Collaborative Mission for the TFP FreeFlight Server 


This Project is intended to allow the flying community to contribute to the unified TFP FreeFlight mission for DCS.

This mission will be a free flight mission first and foremost. 
In order to help grow the DCS community we would like to see feature of this mission *offer*, but not *require* activities of various types. 

Generally speaking, if a player can log onto the mission solo and fly without having to be concerned with getting shot down by ai within 5 minutes flight of the airfield its probably alright. 


The mission "Free_Flight_v13_Day" is the mission currently hosted on the server, its a bit tired and was created in an older version of the Mission Editor. As a result it is in need of a complete overhaul. Any changes made to this mission will be only bugfixes, or small performance tweaks. 

The mission "FreeRange2" is the go-forward mission for TFP, please understand that it is in early alpha and currently is very incomplete. Feel free to check it out, read all the labels and study up on how its basic setup flows. I would prefer to keep the basic structure currently present in the mission as it provides a centralized center of action. Of course I am willing to entertain alternative ideas. 

Contact either Cal, or Dirt_Merchant if you need some advice or have any questions.

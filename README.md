# FlyingPanda-s-DCS-Missions
Unified Collaborative Mission for the TFP FreeFlight Server 


This Project is intended to allow the flying community to contribute to the unified TFP FreeFlight mission for DCS.

This mission will be a free flight mission first and foremost. 
In order to help grow the DCS community we would like to see feature of this mission *offer*, but not *require* activities of various types. 

Generally speaking, if a player can log onto the mission solo and fly without having to be concerned with getting shot down by ai within 5 minutes flight of the airfield its probably alright. 

Contact either Cal, or Dirt_Merchant if you need some advice or have any questions.
